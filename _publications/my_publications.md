The Faroe-Bank Channel (FBC) is a key gateway through which dense overflow water of the Nordic Seas supplies the lower limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Most recently, it was discovered that a deep jet through the Faroe-Shetland Channel carries the bulk of this overflow water, but numerous questions regarding its structure, seasonality, and interannual variability as well as its linkage to atmospheric forcing remain poorly understood. A realistic high-resolution ocean reanalysis (GLORYS12; 1993â€“2018) is, therefore, employed to address these questions. We first confirm that the Faroe-Shetland Channel Jet is a permanent feature in GLORYS12 as well as in an ensemble of low-resolution reanalyses. On seasonal time scales, we find a strong transport covariability between this deep jet and the observed FBC overflow. On interannual time scales, the strength of this deep jet is governed by the wind-forced circulation in the Nordic Seas. Due to the largely barotropic structure of these flows, they have a signature detectable in satellite sea-surface heights. Further, we suggest that the structure of the deep jet is qualitatively consistent with a geostrophic dynamical model that accounts for along-isobath density variations. This study indicates that GLORYS12 is a promising product to study the dense water pathways and dynamics in the Nordic Seas.

The Iceland Basin in the eastern Subpolar North Atlantic is an eddy-rich region characterized by intense anticyclonic eddy activity. Our study present the variability of coherent Anticyclonic Eddies (AEs) generated in this region, using satellite altimetry and two ocean eddy tracking algorithms. The yearly count of AEs in the Iceland Basin reveals a decadal variability similar to that of ocean heat content change in the eastern subpolar gyre. Periods with higher number of AEs coincide with periods of increased ocean heat content, and vice versa. However, both algorithms agree that more than 50% of the detected AEs are confined to the central Iceland Basin. The annual number of AEs also tracks zonal shifts of the subpolar front, a variable that can explain about 53 (77)% of the interannual (decadal) variability of AEs in the Iceland Basin. Finally, a Lagrangian approach is used to demonstrate that the amount of subtropical versus subpolar water masses reaching the Iceland Basin appears to influence, via baroclinic instability, the generation of AEs.
